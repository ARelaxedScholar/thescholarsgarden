This chapter really flies -- because it's more of a infographic video on paper than an actual book -- through the subjects of branding, which are explained here [[Litterature Notes/The Fashion Business Manuel/Branding 101\|Branding 101]].

But it is still important to note here the main takebacks.

First your core values should be easily definable, as in summarizable in a few words no more.
Something like elegant, avant-garde, traditional or contemporal???, futurist, minimalist. The idea for core value is for something that your customer can latch onto as a simple label for you. These ideas should guide your design decisions and all the visuals around your brand. You shouldn't be afraid to change your values to stay relevant, but your values are not socks either. If you define them you must be sure you understand the responsibilty that comes with flaunting it.

If elegant is one of your supposed value and you write butt jokes in the diction of your branding graphic material, or have pieces that are crass, you are failing your values.

Second, all you do at least with regard to a line should have push one message and one message only. But that message should be simple, short and CLEAR. If you push different ideas through different pieces and each piece is its own thing, it might work in some context, idk, but most likely than not you're just going to confuse your target customer.

Third, your target customer should be clear in mind. From how old he is, to what he believes in, to his type of girls (or boys) everything should be analysed and thought about. DO NOT create multiple target customers unless you have multiple lines to cater to each. Catering to multiple target customers with one line just opens the possibility of betraying both parties or being a meh for both when focusing could have made it a homerun for one group or the other. Be laser-focused.

This chapter also mentions [[Litterature Notes/The Fashion Business Manuel/Focus Groups\|Focus Groups]] which are an interesting to do when there is stuff to criticize, I am not sure if it has relevant to a person who did not do jack yet. It could be usable as a way to track opinions and see on what to work on, what kind of problems people have, but yeah.

Most importantly be consistent! Color palettes, fonts, everything contributes to brand identity, if there's a certain ratio that is envisioned by the creators of the brand with respect to the colors, this ratio cannot be broken when you take the entire collection as a whole. Maybe one piece can go crazy (if there's a good reason behind it), but it should still FIT within the bigger ecosystem and help reach the ratio that is envisioned.

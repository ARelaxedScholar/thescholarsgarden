Ã¹Definition: Your branding is the total sum of everything your company represent -- from your brand name, designs, communication to your key values and business model.

In a simple sentence, branding is the image your business projects to the world.

A pretty recent example of how crucial branding is, is Bud Light. They were a brand known for frat parties, and other stereotypes that I am not familiar with. But after the thing with the trans girl dude, they did something that is the equivalent of spitting to the face of your core demographic and is now suffering dearly for it (if you believe conservative youtube.) The video going around showing lines of people ready to buy beer of other brand names while having the Bud Light stands entirely empty. These people are actively choosing to wait longer because they do not like (and  therefore do not want to be associated with) Bud Light. (Update: 2023-07-19 apparently BudLight really is in deep shit, as they're getting dropped by Costco, and in some places in the US, BudLight is literally cheaper than water.)

In the case of fashion it can be argued that Branding is much more important. Fashion is literally a wearable statement. If your branding does not appeal to the customer base that you're trying to attract you're in trouble. In that same vein, if you already have a customer base, morphing your image in such a way that your core customer base now feels alienated by you is the best way to go out of business quickly, and to become a company no one remembers fondly.

Since branding is everything that characterizes the image of your business it includes marketing, advertisement, user experience, the type of clothes you design, price range, communication, **name**, etc, etc.

You should stand out. You shouldn't be a trend follower. And more than anything you should not try to please everyone. 

The idea of pleasing everyone sounds appealing, broader market share, right? Wrong! Well maybe you're right, but the only things that are **liked** by everyone are the things that are **loved** by nobody; the things that do not make waves; the things that do not make statements; the things that don't have any clear meaning and ideal and are therefore totally open to whatever the viewer sees in it. Only notable exception I could think off is chicken, and even then chicken is only good because of all the spices one must put in it to season it properly--the cook must take a stand and will alienate "someone". To make it spicy or to make it tamer; to barbecue it, grill it or even fry it or just put it in some kind of soup; to make it the center piece of the meal of an aside; no matter how excellent the cooking/presentation it will only resonate/suit the palate of those which like this sort of things. 

All that to say, considering the vast (and wild) amount of variety that exists in today's world, if your brand pleases everyone. Then it is so-mind numbingly boring that no one treats your brand as a reference, your only the essentials brand. And maybe that's fine, maybe that's exactly what you're going for, but for everyone else you should aim for something that is beautiful and that will please to your core audience specifically, and if by accident a broader part of the market ends up liking it, good! But never frustrate your day ones and those that make your brand what it is, for the sake of wider appeal; even if that works your business will have lost its soul. Only do if you're trying to rehaul the business from the ground up, and even then, maybe it'd be better to just open a new line for whatever new direction you have in mind.

Now, how to brand? I'll put that in another note.

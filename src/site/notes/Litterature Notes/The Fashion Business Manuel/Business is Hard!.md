We all want the glamor and financial freedom that comes with being CEO of a big company. And for me, the idea of being at the head of a brand and making money out of clothes and seeing people wearing MY clothes is something that makes me really for lack of a better word *cough* **hard**.

But that's not what I meant by it's hard.
On the road to business success, one must be ready to meet:
- Failure - You will likely fail often, and you must be mentally strong enough to endure it
- Deserts -  Success will take a long time, and sometimes you will be walking towards an oasis that you're not even sure exists. If you drop dead you'll never ascertain whether or not the oasis was genuine or a mirage. The only garantee there is, is the one of failure and disappointment if one gives up on the way to success. All one can do is keep on trudging keeping their eyes on the goal.
- Loneliness - It is probably possible to make a successful business while having a social life. But it is undeniable that a lot of people that succeed in *anything* (arguably most)  do so at the cost of family and friend and sleep, and all that can compound together to a crippling emotional load.
- Unscertainty - Sometimes no matter the amount of the amount of thought and research that goes into something you will not be 100% sure of what is the right option and will need to take a leap of faith, IDEALLY you're doing this with God's direction and he directs you. But even then at times you might feel lost about whether or not what you are doing is even worth it.

This is why before going into business take the itme to make sure that it is something that God directs you towards and to make sure to pray with regards of every decision that you have to take. Stealing the words of some people on some show, a big team is not needed. All you need is 3 BAD motherF**\kers to help you. For a business more likely you'll need more than that but it is a fact that for matters like that quality trumps quantity.

Don't go into business with dreams in your eyes, unless you've properly considered the possible years of toil and unrewarded labor that it will likely take before that breakout hit.

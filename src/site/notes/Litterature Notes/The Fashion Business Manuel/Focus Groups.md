A meeting where a group of people (ideally 6-10) will meet up to evaluate how well a business follows a given set of guidelines. 

These are basically like interviews with multiple people, or maybe more like samples to check the opinion of a group of people relevant to your company (target customers, key influencers, stakeholders, etc.) to make sure thing are going well.

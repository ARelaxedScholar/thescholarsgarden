First to know what is branding go to [[Litterature Notes/The Fashion Business Manuel/Branding 101\|Branding 101]]

To create strong branding, you need to create branding that will charm those that you want to attract. That will make them rip their heart and place it on a silver platter if you so wish.

Sounds maniacal? It kinda is, I don't know why I went with that.

But if your customer base is **that** loyal to you, you're doing something good.

The seven steps to Creating Strong Branding are
1. Decide on your brand's core value
2. Define key features or benefits
3. Characterize your target customers
4. Analyze your competitor
5. Build a visual identity
6. Set your tone-of-voice
7. Reinforce your brand values.

## Your brand's core values
These values define who you are as a business and what kind of causes you will show yourself in. The big reason why most business nowadays do so much LGBT stuff--to an absurd level at times--is because most businesses are directed by God-less heathens who want he world to burn and also because appealing to politics and cajoling the woke crowd is a decent way to make rich socialist types with a need to virtue signal flock to your pastures. You need to define what your business will represent, what kind of values. This will impact everything. Both in the marketing side of things with what kind of causes you can represent and support, what kind of things to denounce, but also with respect to the actual inner workings. You can't be a business that claims to be christian and verbally assault your employees, or lie to get ahead.

## Your key features or benefits
People can agree with you, and that alone is enough to reject some (those who don't align with your values) and to open the wallet of others (those either desperate for corporate support of their values, or those that support you just to spite the opposition); but you can have the best values around, if your product is shit or doesn't stand out you're just another sheep in the herd. People are not totally stupid! At least when it comes to acquiring stuff, they will look for what benefits them the most, for things that solve problems that they have (it is painfully important that they KNOW they have that problem, giving a dictionary to a dog is stupid since the dog will never realize he doesn't speak human), or for the thing to make them feel good in some other way. Maybe the fact that your clothes are not made with the blood of slave children gives the buyer a inflated sense of pride and a chance to virtue signal, maybe your clothes appeal to a specific niche of fashion from an anime that no one knows about except those who know and you become the only stop for those who always thought,*damn **this** would look so good in real life*. No matter what it is, you must find it and define it clearly. The customer must always leave a transaction with you feeling that he gained something and that what you provide is genuinely worth the price.

## Your target customers
Rich people? Student? Anime fans? This is likely the most important in that list. A good trick is to give name to your stand in target customers and make everything from A-to-Z be the kind of stuff that would make a Janet (assuming that's the name of your stand-in) cream... That aside you also want to choose a demographic that makes sense. If I choose as my demographic christian anime fans who loves singing... yeah sure there might be a few (I am one of em), but this market size is so small that I'd be shooting myself in the foot aiming for them. So you need a target customer that is both specific enough that they'd have things they like and don't like. And both general enough that members of sub groups of a given thing might like your work. If we keep the christian idea, your target customer being a "christians" instead of a "presbyterian christian who was recently converted and is looking to proselytize" is probably better. There is a point to be made that "christians" is much too vague, the same way "anime fans" is.

Christians like anime fans, and like most other things are not a monolith, and thus a design that would please a given christian might make another  cringe or shoot themselves. I could see myself wearing a tshirt with a bible verse or some christian imagery (especially if it merges well with a more street aesthetic), I don't see myself wearing some loud hoodie with a big lion on the chest, GOD IS GOOD in all caps on the back and bright yellow sleeves *with crossed on them*. For anime, a subtle design with fits that are inspired by characters I like and symbology that only those in the know would understand is cool as heck; what's the opposite of that? You already know what it is... If you really don't *ahegao*, *sauce*, *black and white*, *cringe incarnated*.

In that line of logic, try to detail the life of your target customer. Create story for them. What are their every day pain points, what are their aspirations, what does their family life look like. etc. etc.

## Analyze your competitor.
Stealing from one person makes you a thief, stealing from multiple makes you a thief also... but if we're talking art, it's called research. As a fledgling chick with ideals and big dreams, you need references of companies that embody that dream in some way or another, or of companies that occupy the space that you're trying to invade in order to learn what to do and become big yourself. The more time you spend at this stage, the less likely you are to make dumb mistakes that might arise from navigating blind. 

## Build a visual identity, set your tone of voice and reinforce your values
These steps have been made into one since, they derive from the aforementioned work and are kinda linked together. If I have a more grungey visual identity, the way I adress my customers and interact with them will be in line with that (unless I intentionally break that mold for stylistic/whiplash reasons), likewise if I am going for a more prim-and-proper brand, adressing customers politely makes sense with the image and a casual tone would actively impede the identity we're going for. Your visual identity should reinforce your values, your tone of voice should also reinforce your values (don't use insults or slur if you claim to be christian), everything you be in accordance to your core values. Visual identity and tone of voice being the first thing people will see and hear about you, it is even more primordial that this detail is nailed properly.
